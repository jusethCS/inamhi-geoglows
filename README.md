# INAMHI GEOGLOWS PORTAL
This repository contains the new version of the INAMHI GEOGLOWS platform, a collaboration among the Instituto Nacional de Meteorología e Hidrología of Ecuador (INAMHI), Fundacion Ecociencia, and the SERVIR Amazonia Program. The platform has been rebuilt using technologies such as Node.js, Django, and Docker to enhance scalability, performance, and system maintainability. It contains the complete source code, including Docker configuration files to facilitate the deployment of the portal in production environments. The platform provides access to meteorological and hydrological data, interactive visualization tools, and forecasts to support hidrometeorological risk management and decision-making in Ecuador.
